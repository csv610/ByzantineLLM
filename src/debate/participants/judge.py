Topic: {topic}

DEBATER'S ARGUMENTS:
{arguments_text}

Evaluate this debater's performance on the following criteria (each 0-10):

1. EVIDENCE QUALITY (0-10) - CRITICAL FACTOR:
   - Count and analyze citations, specific references, and factual claims
   - Award high scores for: peer-reviewed studies, well-known statements, established research, specific data
   - Award low scores for: unsupported claims, vague generalizations, logical leaps without evidence
   - This is weighted most heavily in scoring

2. Argument Quality (0-10):
   - Clarity, structure, logical flow, and persuasiveness
   - How well ideas are presented and organized
   - Coherence and comprehensiveness

3. Logical Consistency (0-10):
   - Consistency across all arguments presented
   - Avoidance of contradictions and logical fallacies
   - Sound reasoning and deduction

4. Responsiveness to Gaps (0-10):
   - How well opponent's points are directly addressed
   - Specific rebuttals to opponent's claims
   - Filling logical gaps identified by opponent

SCORING METHODOLOGY:
- Maximum points go to debaters with most irrefutable arguments backed by facts
- References to well-known statements, research, and citations boost scores
- Unsubstantiated claims lower scores significantly
- Calculate overall_score as: (evidence_quality × 0.4) + (argument_quality × 0.2) + (logical_consistency × 0.2) + (responsiveness_to_gaps × 0.2)
